# Hangman
Code for Hangman game in Python using turtle library graphic functions
## Summary
To make my project # 2 from the "Python is easy" course of {PIRPLE.com} I studied the turtle graphic library for Python and used it in my Hangman game code. I also used the 3000 most common English words dictionary by Education First (EF) organization - https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-3000-words/.

I tried to explain how I used different functions from turtle library with comments within in my code.
